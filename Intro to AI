                    Intro To AI

->  Artificial -:
            • Borrowing characteristics from human
            • Thinking
            • Perception
            • Action

->  Intelligence : Find solutions to complex problems


->  Artificial Intelligence : Phenomenon of decoding human intelligence to machines


->  Flowchart

                      Thinking, Perception and action


->  Types of AI -:
            • Weak AI / Artificial Narrow Intelligence : when machines has limited range of abilities
            • Strong AI / Artificial General Intelligence : machines work at par with humans
            • Artificial Super Intelligence : machines match and surpass the human mind


->  eg. Alexa & Siri,Self driving cars etc.


->  AI is progressing nowadays because : (1)  Greater Computational power
                                         (2)  Availability of huge data
                                         (3)  Best Algos


->  Approaches of AI :
            • Thinking humanly  => 
                            * Through interospection 
                            * Through psychological experiments.
            • Thinking rationally =>
                            * Laws of thoughts/logic 
                            * Syllogism approach
            • Acting humanly =>
                            * Turing test approach
            • Acting rationally =>
                            * Rational agent approach


->  Requirements for machine to pass the turing test :
            • Natural Language Processing : In order to communicate successfully in naturally language with the machine.
            • Knowledge Representation : to store what the machine knows or hears.
            • Automated Reasoning : to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
            • Machine Learning : to detect and extrapolate patterns and to adapt new circumstances.


->  In order to pass the total turing test, a machine must possess:
            • Computer Vision : to perceive objects.
            • Robotics : to manipulate and move objects.


->  Scope of AI :
            • Medical domain
            • Online gaming
            • Future prediction
            • Marketing
            • Banking
            • Agriculture
            • Society
            • Self driving vehicles
            • Social media
