                    Intro To AI

->  Artificial -:
            • Borrowing characteristics from human
            • Thinking
            • Perception
            • Action

->  Intelligence -:
            •Find solutions to complex problems


->  Artificial Intelligence : Phenomenon of decoding human intelligence 
    to machines


->  Flowchart

                      Thinking, Perception and action



->  Types of AI -:
            • Weak AI / Artificial Narrow Intelligence : when machines has limited range of abilities
            • Strong AI / Artificial General Intelligence : machines work at par with humans
            • Artificial Super Intelligence : machines match and surpass the human mind

    eg. Alexa & Siri,Self driving cars etc.
